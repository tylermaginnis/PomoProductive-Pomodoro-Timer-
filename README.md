## Technologies Used

- Three.js (r132)
- WebGL
- Custom GLSL Shaders
- HTML5/CSS3
- JavaScript

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**
   - A modern web browser with WebGL support
   - No additional installation required

2. **Installation**
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PomoProductive.git

   # Navigate to the project directory
   cd PomoProductive

   # Open index.html in your browser
   # You can use any local server, for example:
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

3. **Usage**
   - Open the application in your web browser
   - Use the +/- buttons to adjust timer duration
   - Click 'Start' to begin the timer
   - Use 'Pause' to temporarily stop
   - Use 'Reset' to restart the timer
   - Select different themes from the dropdown menu

## Performance Considerations

- The application uses hardware acceleration through WebGL
- Optimized particle systems and shader effects
- Adaptive quality based on device capabilities
- Fallback to basic UI if WebGL is not available

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+
- Opera 76+
